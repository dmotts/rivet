# Settings

## Description

`Settings` is an interface that encapsulates the configuration options required for the integration with OpenAI services in the graph execution process.

## Definition

```typescript
export interface Settings {
  openAiKey: string;
  openAiOrganization?: string;
}
```

## Properties

### openAiKey

Type: `string`

The `openAiKey` property represents the API key for OpenAI. This key is used to authenticate your application with OpenAI services. It is a required property for the `Settings` interface.

### openAiOrganization

Type: `string`

The `openAiOrganization` property represents the organization ID to use for OpenAI. Use this if your API key's default organization is not the one you want to use. This property is optional.

## Usage

The `Settings` interface is part of the `RunGraphOptions` type and is used to provide OpenAI-specific settings for the graph execution process.

```typescript
const options: RunGraphOptions = {
  // Other properties...
  settings: {
    openAiKey: 'your-openai-key',
    openAiOrganization: 'your-openai-organization-id',
  },
};
```
