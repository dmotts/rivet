# API Overview

This is the API overview for the `@ironclad/rivet-node` Node.js library. Each of the exports in the `api.ts` file is documented in its own page, as linked below:

## Requirements

Rivet node requires Node.js 16 or higher.

## Core

Every type and method exported from `@ironclad/rivet-core` is re-exported from `@ironclad/rivet-node` for convenience. See the [core API overview](../core/overview) for more information.

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's how you could update the API overview:
