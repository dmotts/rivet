# Plugins

Plugins allow authors to extend the functionality of Rivet, such as adding new nodes that
you can use in your graphs.

## Enabling Plugins

To enable a built-in plugin, go to the **Project** tab on the left panel. You will see a **Plugins** section there. Click
the **+** button to add a plugin to the project.

The modal the pops up will allow you to either enable one of the built-in plugins, or enter a URL to
load a remote plugin.
